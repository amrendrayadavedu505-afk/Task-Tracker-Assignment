Task Tracker (Console Application)
This project is a simple C# console-based Task Tracker created for my university assignment.The aim is to learn file handling, searching, sorting, logging, and unit testing in .NET.The program allows a user to create and manage tasks. Each task has a title, description, assignee, start date, due date, priority, and status.All tasks are saved in a JSON file so the data stays after closing the app.

 Features
Create Task: Add a new task with title, description, due date, priority, and assignee.

Search Tasks: Find tasks quickly by typing part of the name or a full task ID.

Update Status: Mark tasks as To-Do, In-Progress, Done, or Archived.

Sorting: Sort tasks by due date (custom insertion sort algorithm) or priority.

Overdue Report: View overdue tasks and export them to a CSV file for record keeping.

Persistent Storage: Automatically saves all tasks in tasks.json
